# Vector{2,3} operators / and /=
# Matrix{3,4} setScale(...) must work the same for uniform and nonuniform scale
# Abreviations changed to gvec3, gvec2, gquat etc..
# implement vectors: double dotProduct(gvec3 v1, gvec3 v2)
* static methods in vectors and matrices that can be used as utility functions

* Catmull-Rom 2&3:

    # void rebuild(..., int closed) compiles the spline
    
    - Frenet Frame (defines unit coordinate system on a point on a curve):
        # gvec3 calcTangent(double t)
        # gvec3 calcNormal(double t)
        
        - Intercept inflexions and keep current frame during inflexions and on straight lines
        # Intercept c2 incontinuity and make curve smooth
        # make arc-lenght reparametrization and lookup table
        
        - setStartingTangent(gvec3)
        - setEndingTangent(gvec3)
